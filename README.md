Hello, you can call me Miyako, but that's just my nickname, i'm 22.
Currently, i'm trying to learn Java and Python as well as SQL/MySQL. In addition to coding, i'm also trying 3D Modeling and Drawing with a tablet i recently bought.
I'm also interested in learning C/C# and try HLSL on Unity, there's also more but those are the ones that interest me the most and the ones i'll try to focus on for now...
GitHub will mainly be used for me to save my projects, have a linear preview of my own evolution and share some projects if i think they would help anyone in any way
Something i should say is that English isn't my primary/native language, so maybe there's some wrong text, but i'm trying to learn it and i'll try to correct it if i find it's not right...
For any reason, if you wish to contact me, please use my E-mail: " kuraimiyakoofficial@gmail.com " or my Discord: " K.Miyako#2483 ".

Thanks for checking my profile, and hope you have a nice day ^^
